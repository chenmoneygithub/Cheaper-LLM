# Cheaper-LLM

Roadmap:

## Cache
Don't fire any queries if we can find a similar one.

## Model Cascading
Pick up the right model from our model collection.

## Prompt Adaptation
We can do:
- Prompt pruning, we need to understand the price model for each service.
- Per-model prompt customization. 
- Task aware prompt adaptation.

We can start with cache.
